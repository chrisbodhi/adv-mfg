    <h2 id="an-interdisciplinary-seminar">An Interdisciplinary Seminar</h2>
<p><strong>Course Description</strong></p>
<p>This seminar explores the emerging paradigm of adaptive manufacturing—production systems designed for reconfiguration, resilience, and distributed coordination rather than scale and standardization. Drawing on control theory, operations research, economics, and design theory, students will develop a conceptual toolkit for understanding why manufacturing paradigms shift, what enables new paradigms to survive, and how adaptive systems might reshape the geography and economics of production.</p>
<p>The course pairs theoretical foundations with primary sources, fiction, and case studies. Students will engage with both the "what" (technical mechanisms) and the "why" (economic and social forces that make paradigms viable or obsolete).</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong></p>
<p>No specific technical background required. The seminar assumes intellectual curiosity across disciplines and comfort with ambiguity. Students from engineering, business, design, policy, and the humanities are equally welcome.</p>

<h3 id="week-16-the-moral-economy-of-making">Week 16: The Moral Economy of Making</h3>
<p><strong>Core question</strong>: What is manufacturing <em>for</em>?</p>
<p><strong>Theory</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The theology of work: labor as participation in creation, not just production of goods</li>
<li>Subsidiarity: decisions should be made at the lowest competent level (the cell as subsidiarity in action)</li>
<li>The common good vs. aggregate utility—why the framing matters</li>
<li>Technology as servant, not master: the principle of subordination</li>
<li>Stewardship of creation: manufacturing that doesn't merely extract</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reading</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pope Leo XIII, <em>Rerum Novarum</em> (1891), selections—the original Catholic engagement with industrial capitalism</li>
<li>Pope John Paul II, <em>Laborem Exercens</em> (1981), sections on the priority of labor over capital and the meaning of work</li>
<li>Pope Francis, <em>Laudato Si'</em> (2015), chapter 3 on technology and chapter 5 on integral ecology</li>
<li>E.F. Schumacher, <em>Small Is Beautiful</em>, chapter on "Buddhist Economics" (yes, Buddhist—but deeply compatible; Schumacher was Catholic)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Optional deeper reading</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alasdair MacIntyre, <em>After Virtue</em>, chapter on practices and institutions</li>
<li>Wendell Berry, essays on economics and locality (<em>What Are People For?</em> or <em>The Art of the Commonplace</em>)</li>
<li>Dorothy Day's writings on work and dignity</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fiction</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Walter M. Miller Jr., <em>A Canticle for Leibowitz</em>, Part 1 ("Fiat Homo")—monks preserving technical knowledge after collapse; the relationship between making, meaning, and continuity</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Discussion questions</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The humanoid robot thesis implicitly asks: how do we replace human labor? What if that's the wrong question?</li>
<li>Subsidiarity suggests distributed, local decision-making. How does this map onto adaptive cell architecture?</li>
<li>What does "integral human development" mean in a manufacturing context? Is there a version of automation that elevates rather than displaces?</li>
<li>Reshoring as solidarity: what would it mean to design supply chains around relationship rather than pure efficiency?</li>
<li>The "Gospel of work"—can manufacturing be a witness? To what?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Provocation</strong>:</p>
<p>The secular discourse on automation asks: how do we maximize output while minimizing labor cost? Catholic Social Teaching asks: how do we design systems where work remains meaningful, where workers retain dignity, where technology serves human flourishing rather than subordinating it?</p>
<p>These are not the same optimization target. They produce different factories.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise</strong>:</p>
<p>Redesign a manufacturing cell—or a network of cells—with subsidiarity, dignity, and stewardship as primary constraints rather than throughput and cost. What changes? What stays the same?</p>

<h2 id="a-note-on-interdisciplinarity">A Note on Interdisciplinarity</h2>
<p>This seminar intentionally crosses boundaries that academia usually respects. Control theorists don't read James C. Scott. Economists don't read science fiction. Designers don't study queuing theory.</p>
<p>The premise is that adaptive manufacturing is an inherently interdisciplinary problem, and the people who will solve it need to be comfortable with partial knowledge across many domains rather than complete knowledge in one.</p>
<p>You will feel like a beginner in every unit. That's the point. The goal is not mastery but orientation—knowing enough to ask good questions, recognize patterns, and learn quickly when you encounter these ideas in the wild.</p>
<p>The real work begins after the seminar ends.</p>
